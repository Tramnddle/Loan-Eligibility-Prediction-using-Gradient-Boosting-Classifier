# Loan Approval/Eligibility Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether a loan should be granted to a customer based on various factors, such as credit history, income, loan amount, and employment details. The dataset used is a synthetic dataset of over 100,000 loan records, designed to mimic real-world loan data, to determine the best way to predict loan eligibility.

## Responsibilities

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
  - Cleaned and processed a dataset with over 100,000 records, which included features like loan status, credit score, income, loan amount, and employment data.
  - Addressed missing values, outliers, and applied necessary data transformations.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Engineered relevant features, including loan amount, credit score, homeownership status, annual income, monthly debt, and others to improve the modelâ€™s prediction accuracy.

- **Model Development**  
  - Built a classification model to predict loan eligibility using techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
  
- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, aiming for a minimum of 70% accuracy.
  - Fine-tuned model hyperparameters to enhance prediction results.

- **Outcome**  
  - The final model successfully predicted loan eligibility, providing a data-driven approach to the loan approval process and improving risk management for the company.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Evaluation Criteria

The model was considered successful with an accuracy rate of at least 70%.
